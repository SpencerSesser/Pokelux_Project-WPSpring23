Web Programming Spring 2023 Project.
Pokelux is an elegant solution for the avid fan to learn more about their Pokemon. It queries a public database and displays the information to the user in an easily consumable format. The graphics can be updated as more information is added to the website.

To use:
Download all of the files, keep them together within one folder, seperated how they are within this repository, and run index.html.

Questions or comments are always welcome. Thanks!
